# Dextera is a BEP20 token launched through IDO on November 30th, 2021. With the meaning behind Dextera Instrumenta translating to "the right tools", as our name suggests, we want to become synonymous with the tools people will use in their daily crypto lives. Dextera aims to not only develop some of the core platforms the typical utility token offers, but beyond that we want to establish platforms and partnerships that will support leading edge applications meant to improve the overall crypto community. With the possibility of cryptocurrency reaching mass adoption, Dextera will help to maintain the security and individualism of people's holdings within the DeFi network through staking and farming.
